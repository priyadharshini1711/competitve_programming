/*
Remove Integers with Repeated Digits - X to Y 
The program must accept two integers X and Y as the input. The program must print all the integers from X to Y which do not have continuously repeated digits that is the digits are repeated and all the digits in the number are same. 

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= X <= Y X <= Y <= 1000000 

Input Format: The first line contains the values of X and Y separated by space(s).

 Output Format: The first line contains the integers from X to Y which do not have continuously repeated digits. 

Example Input/Output 1:

 Input: 5 15 
Output: 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 13 14 15 
Explanation: The integers from 5 to 15 are 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Here the integer with repeated digits is 11 Hence the output is 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 13 14 15 

Example Input/Output 2: 
Input: 1 50 
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 45 46 47 48 49 50
